— set for the current session:
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;
— set globally:
SET GLOBAL FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;

Now we can INSERT or UPDATE rows in our table without triggering a foreign key constraint fails.

After we are done with the manipulation query, we can set the FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS active again by setting its value to 1:

— set for the current session:
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;
— set globally:
SET GLOBAL FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;
